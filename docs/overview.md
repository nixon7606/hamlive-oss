# Overview

Ham.Live is a browser-first web application that helps amateur radio operators discover, join, and run "nets" — coordinated on-air meetups where stations check-in, exchange reports, and follow a moderated agenda.

This document provides a product-oriented overview focusing on what the system does for users. For technical architecture and implementation details, see [Architecture](architecture.md).

## Product Overview

### What Ham.Live provides

- **Net discovery and scheduling** — users can find active nets or browse scheduled nets and follow those they care about
- **Real-time presence & interactions** — when on a net page the site captures presence, renders an ordered station list, and surfaces live interactions such as "hand", "highlight", "check state" and signal reports
- **Net control (NCS features)** — designated net controllers can start/stop nets, assign roles, and perform administrative actions to manage participant flow
- **Chat and media attachments** — real-time chat via GetStream.io with inline image sharing and server‑side token generation to protect API secrets (see [Chat System](chat-system.md))
- **Follow and notifications** — users may follow nets and receive announcements or summaries when nets start or change

### Primary user journeys

- **Join a net:** navigate to a net page, client captures presence and displays the canonical station list. Presence is updated frequently and reconciled with SSE or polling responses so the UI stays current
- **Run a net (NCS):** the net controller starts the net, watches the station queue, assigns roles, and uses admin commands exposed by the server to manage the session
- **Interact:** participants submit interactions (hands, checks, sig reports) that are applied optimistically in the UI and confirmed by server responses (SSE or next poll)

### Key user roles

- **Participant:** joins nets, sends interactions, and views the live station order
- **Net Control / NCS:** authorized to start/stop nets, assign roles, and call administrative endpoints
- **Admin / Operator:** manages NetProfiles, runs recovery or maintenance commands and monitors system health

## Technical Overview

Ham.Live is a Node.js + Express web application with a no-bundler, reactive client framework. It presents and manages **nets** (live radio nets) and station interactions, serving server-rendered EJS views plus JSON APIs, with real-time updates pushed to clients over Server-Sent Events.

**See [HL-main.svg](HL-main.svg) for a visual diagram** of the core runtime flows.

### Key technologies

- **Backend**: Node.js with Express.js
- **Database**: MongoDB with Mongoose ODM
- **Authentication**: magic-link email (primary) + optional Google OAuth, signed `cookie-session` cookies
- **Real-time**: Server-Sent Events with polling fallback
- **Frontend**: TypeScript ES modules, Custom Elements, and reactive stores (no bundler)

### High-level runtime flow

1. A browser loads an EJS view (e.g. `/views/livenet/:id`). The view injects `serverInfo` attributes and loads a per-view ES module from the compiled client output (`/js/byView/<view>/main.js`).
2. Client code (widgets and libraries) requests data from the JSON API (`/api/data/*`) and subscribes to presence or live updates via SSE (`/api/sse/livenets/:id`) or short polling.
3. The server responds to API calls, issues tokens for GetStream.io chat, and pushes real-time `LiveNetDetails` updates through the SSE manager (`realtimeClients`).
4. Client stores apply updates optimistically and reconcile against the next server response.

### Data Flow Architecture

**Client → Server:**

- Widgets use `EndPointClient` for user-driven actions
- Stores use `Looper` polling or subscribe to SSE to receive `LiveNetDetails` payloads
- Optimistic updates applied locally, confirmed by server responses

**Server → Client:**

- Express controllers handle `/api/*` routes and return `EndPointResponse` envelopes
- Real-time updates via SSE (`/api/sse/livenets/:id`) or polling fallback
- `realtimeClients` manages SSE connections and pushes live updates

### Development Architecture

**Per-view pattern:**

- Each page loads a small ESM entry script for that view (e.g., `/js/byView/<view>/main.js`)
- Entry scripts initialize stores and widgets specific to that page
- Shared libraries provide common functionality across views

**Widget pattern:**

- Custom elements extending `HamLiveElement<T>` subscribe to reactive stores
- Widgets implement `getTemplate()`, `didMyDataSegmentChange()`, and `render()` methods
- Shadow DOM encapsulation with shared CSS variables for theming

### Domain Logic & Persistence

**Core business logic:**

- Domain logic and state management are centralized in `SharedNetOps` functions with comprehensive validation and permission checking
- All net operations, interactions, and state transitions go through this canonical business layer

For detailed information about system operations and data management, see:

- [Background Jobs](background-jobs.md) — Scheduled tasks, CLI tools, and asynchronous processing
- [Shared Net Operations](shared-net-ops.md) — Core business logic and domain operations

**Data persistence:**

- MongoDB with Mongoose schemas, including FlexOptions for runtime configuration
- Comprehensive indexing for performance and well-defined relationships between collections

**Third-party integrations:**

- GetStream.io (chat with inline image sharing), SendGrid (email), and external lookups (QRZ.com)
- Wired via server helpers and token/endorsement routes so credentials stay server-side

### Why This Architecture Matters

**For developers:**

- **Small runtime footprint**: The client avoids large frameworks and bundles; pages load per-view ES modules and use native browser primitives where possible
- **Clear separation**: Server-side endorsement routes prevent exposing secrets; controllers and compiled `server/dist` artifacts reveal the authoritative endpoint list and payload shapes
- **Deterministic testability**: The repository includes canonical LiveNet payload examples so tests can stub endpoints deterministically

**For integrators:**

- **Standard envelopes**: All server responses use the canonical `EndPointResponse` JSON envelope
- **Real-time options**: Choose between SSE streams or polling based on client capabilities
- **Clear API contracts**: Comprehensive endpoint documentation with example payloads
